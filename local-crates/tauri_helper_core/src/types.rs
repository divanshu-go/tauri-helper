    /// with `#[tauri::command]`, even if they do not have the `#[auto_collect_command]` attribute.

    /// When set to `false` (the default), only functions with both `#[tauri::command]`

    ///

    /// explicitly annotate the functions you want to collect with `#[auto_collect_command]`.
    /// This ensures better control over which commands are included in your Tauri application
    /// and avoids accidentally collecting unintended commands.
    ///
    /// # Example
    ///
    /// ```rust
    /// #[tauri::command]
    /// #[auto_collect_command] // Explicitly opt-in to command collection
    /// fn my_command() {
    ///     println!("Good Opt-In")
    /// }
    /// ```
    ///
    /// Setting `collect_all` to `true` should only be used in specific cases where you
    /// want to automatically collect all `#[tauri::command]` functions without explicit
    /// opt-in. Use this option with caution.

    /// `[workspace]` table), the current crate (`"."`) is scanned automatically.
